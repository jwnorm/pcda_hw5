When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in.

We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in.

Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you.

I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I’m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past.

Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I’m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I’m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

In this map I lay out the subject of biology and how all of the sub-disciplines are related to each other: microbiology, genetics, bioengineering, anatomy, physiology, medicine, neuroscience, ecology, zoology to name but a few.\n\nBiology spans the scales, from biophysics and biochemistry studying the basic elements of life, to the study of whole ecosystems and the environment. If there is one word that describes biology, it is complexity. There is a huge amount we still don’t understand about how life works, how it started and how it ended up with us.\n\nPOSTERS: If you would like to buy a poster of this map, they are available here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman\n \nI have also made a version available for educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/?\n\nThanks so much to my supporters on Patreon.

If there is one word that describes biology, it is complexity. There is a huge amount we still don’t understand about how life works, how it started and how it ended up with us.\n\nPOSTERS: If you would like to buy a poster of this map, they are available here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman\n \nI have also made a version available for educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/?\n\nThanks so much to my supporters on Patreon.

Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.\n \nFor the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.\n \nRead more: https://www.llnl.gov/news/physicist-declassifies-rescued-nuclear-test-films\n\nLLNL Copyright and Reuse Policy: https://www.llnl.gov/copyright-and-reuse\n\nSee the declassified LLNL tests: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list..."

doHVMJnuvDA,17.28.12,"Lost in Light II","Sriram Murali",28,2017-08-15T18:26:40.000Z,"astronomy"|"light pollution"|"stars"|"night sky"|"dark sky"|"short film",7938,430,9,42,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doHVMJnuvDA/default.jpg,False,False,False,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

doHVMJnuvDA,17.29.12,"Lost in Light II - a short film on Light Pollution","Sriram Murali",28,2017-08-15T18:26:40.000Z,"astronomy"|"light pollution"|"stars"|"night sky"|"dark sky"|"short film",22664,1052,25,84,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doHVMJnuvDA/default.jpg,False,False,False,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself.

It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection.

And we've only begun to understand the effects.

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Örn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

doHVMJnuvDA,18.04.01,"Lost in Light II - a short film on Light Pollution","Sriram Murali",28,2017-08-15T18:26:40.000Z,"astronomy"|"light pollution"|"stars"|"night sky"|"dark sky"|"short film",61013,2223,53,165,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doHVMJnuvDA/default.jpg,False,False,False,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances.

Tech support, troubleshoot, cant help me because i didnt buy insurance, said i still would have to pay $75 for a replacement even with insurance(even if they sold me a lemon phone that was less than a month old) told me to go to a sprint store to see if they could help.\n-went to sprint store , waited 45 min , repair tech troubleshoot phone ,phone still not responding. \n-tech checks my account status to see what they could do, said i didnt have insurance so they couldnt do an exchange. Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery.

Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Örn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances.

Tech support, troubleshoot, cant help me because i didnt buy insurance, said i still would have to pay $75 for a replacement even with insurance(even if they sold me a lemon phone that was less than a month old) told me to go to a sprint store to see if they could help.\n-went to sprint store , waited 45 min , repair tech troubleshoot phone ,phone still not responding. \n-tech checks my account status to see what they could do, said i didnt have insurance so they couldnt do an exchange. Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery.

Link below\nThroughout much of the analog television era, Sony was the fairly undisputed king of TVs.  Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Örn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

Link below\nThroughout much of the analog television era, Sony was the fairly undisputed king of TVs.  Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Örn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

Recently, when speaking to a museum employee conducting research into the 1992 Groundbreaking for inclusion into the new ribbon cutting at the rebuilt SFMOMA, SRL was informed that the Museum had systematically removed all reference to SRL even being at the 1992 Groundbreaking!  The only remaining historical document is this SRL produced video.\n\nIt takes serious skills to stage a show at a major museum that would provoke them into completely rewriting the show out of their own history.

Recently, when speaking to a museum employee conducting research into the 1992 Groundbreaking for inclusion into the new ribbon cutting at the rebuilt SFMOMA, SRL was informed that the Museum had systematically removed all reference to SRL even being at the 1992 Groundbreaking!  The only remaining historical document is this SRL produced video.\n\nIt takes serious skills to stage a show at a major museum that would provoke them into completely rewriting the show out of their own history.

And it was totally worth it.\n\nWe wanted to make a video to pay homage to the good ol' days, so instead of heading to our computers to cook up some video graphics,, we went the stop-motion route. Speks is all about going off-screen and diving into shapeable, moldable, tactile fun. We like to think that our balls have endless possibilities with zero expectations. Our video shows just that. \n\nMoral of the story; If you want to create a mesmerizing stop-motion video with Speks, you can. If you want to mash them around and just go to town on them, you can do that too. We support you either way.\n\nSee more at www.getspeks.com."

But then those haunting vocals hit my ears...and blew my mind. It was like a punch deep in my soul. It's hard to explain that feeling when you first hear a song and you immediately fall in love with it. Almost like you've known it all along.\n\nI hadn't even planned to start working on this film yet, but I was so inspired that I furiously began to lay down time-lapse clips. I couldn't stop pouring over it. It was last September and I was supposed to be working on Monsoon IV, but I forgot all about it once I heard Ex Makina's Breathe. It almost felt like it was made for a black and white storm film.\n\nAbout halfway through editing, I knew the song title would be my film title as well. It was so perfect I couldn't believe it. Sometimes for me...when I'm chasing or watching an amazing storm...I'll realize I haven't taken a breath in awhile. Never really thought of it until I heard this song.\n\nI love being inspired by other artists. I love soundtracks. I can't imagine the movie Interstellar without that powerful pipe organ soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Music is so important to what I do and I'm so incredibly thankful to husband/wife duo Iain and Rebecca Campbell for writing this amazing song. Thanks to the MusicBed as well for having such fantastic musicians and artists.\n\nIn early 2017, I put together a film called Pulse that was my first ever black and white time-lapse movie. It was so different and fun, I wanted to do a follow-up this year before the next chase season begins. Breathe is made up solely of storm clips from 2017...either from the spring across the central plains or from the monsoon here in the southwest. Some are favorites, some are just ones I knew would be amazing in monochrome and others I used because they fit the music so well.  I also went with a wider aspect ratio on these films to give it more of a cinematic feel.\n\nThis is also the first film I've ever done in full 8K resolution. I'm super excited about that. You may not be able to watch it in that resolution, but it's there if you can. Otherwise, 4K is a must if you can!\n\nI truly hope you enjoy this. For me, I needed something to pass the time and bridge the next few months as I wait for supercells to return to the plains. But honestly, I truly love putting these together. Thanks for all your support in the past and feel free to share!\n\nTechnical Details:\n\nI used two Canon 5DSR's along with a Canon 11-24mm, 35mm, 50mm, 135mm and Sigma Art 50mm. Manfrotto tripods. The final product was edited in Lightroom with LR Timelapse, After Effects and Premiere Pro."

They think if they go to the gym and cycle a bit and do a bit of running then they will obviously shed some of those kilos. The reality is that that does not happen which is why the vast majority of people give up.\n\nIn order to lose a kilo of fat you would probably have to run two marathons. So in many ways it is obviously much easier simply to reduce the amount of calories you eat rather than trying to run them off because you have to do so much exercise to burn calories.\n\nWhat I would recommend is yes, you do exercise because that’s going to improve your mood and it’s very helpful once you’ve lost weight but hoping that simply by doing exercise you’re going to lose weight is really over optimistic.\n\nYou should be aware of these tendencies but as I said if you really want to lose weight the only way to do that is by reducing the calories you eat and switching the sort of food you eat.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nFollow BI UK on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3\nFollow BI UK on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy\nFollow BI UK on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2gsLEds\nRead more on BI UK: uk.businessinsider.com\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nBusiness Insider UK is the largest business news site for British readers and viewers in the UK.

They think if they go to the gym and cycle a bit and do a bit of running then they will obviously shed some of those kilos. The reality is that that does not happen which is why the vast majority of people give up.\n\nIn order to lose a kilo of fat you would probably have to run two marathons. So in many ways it is obviously much easier simply to reduce the amount of calories you eat rather than trying to run them off because you have to do so much exercise to burn calories.\n\nWhat I would recommend is yes, you do exercise because that’s going to improve your mood and it’s very helpful once you’ve lost weight but hoping that simply by doing exercise you’re going to lose weight is really over optimistic.\n\nYou should be aware of these tendencies but as I said if you really want to lose weight the only way to do that is by reducing the calories you eat and switching the sort of food you eat.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nFollow BI UK on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3\nFollow BI UK on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy\nFollow BI UK on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2gsLEds\nRead more on BI UK: uk.businessinsider.com\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nBusiness Insider UK is the largest business news site for British readers and viewers in the UK.

They think if they go to the gym and cycle a bit and do a bit of running then they will obviously shed some of those kilos. The reality is that that does not happen which is why the vast majority of people give up.\n\nIn order to lose a kilo of fat you would probably have to run two marathons. So in many ways it is obviously much easier simply to reduce the amount of calories you eat rather than trying to run them off because you have to do so much exercise to burn calories.\n\nWhat I would recommend is yes, you do exercise because that’s going to improve your mood and it’s very helpful once you’ve lost weight but hoping that simply by doing exercise you’re going to lose weight is really over optimistic.\n\nYou should be aware of these tendencies but as I said if you really want to lose weight the only way to do that is by reducing the calories you eat and switching the sort of food you eat.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nFollow BI UK on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3\nFollow BI UK on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy\nFollow BI UK on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2gsLEds\nRead more on BI UK: uk.businessinsider.com\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nBusiness Insider UK is the largest business news site for British readers and viewers in the UK.

Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy."

The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm"

The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm"

Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy."

Here's what will happen to your body when you exercise regularly.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nIf you're thinking about leading a more active lifestyle, you're not alone. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans have started participating in more sports, fitness, and recreation. Whether you're trying to get fit or build muscle, or you're just tired of the couch, here are some changes you can expect along the way.\n\nWhat happens to your body when you start exercising regularly?\n\nDuring that first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain. But prepare yourself for the day after, when you'll almost certainly get a case of DOMS, short for delayed onset muscle soreness. The soreness will persist for about 72 hours, but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles.\n\nOver the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs, fat, and protein into fuel that your muscles use to do their job, like flex and contract. After six to eight weeks, studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%. With more mitochondria in your cells, you'll start to feel more fit, and your endurance will increase. So running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during that first week.\n\nOnce you're six months in, all that hard work should finally start to show. If your workouts focus on strength training, you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape. You're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point. Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months, but after that more people stick with it.\n\nNow, if you're more focused on cardio, then by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max. VO2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel. Basically, higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer. So a 25% increase in VO2 max, for example, means you can run about 20% farther in the same amount of time.\n\nAfter one year of regular exercise, your bones will be denser, which reduces your risk of osteoporosis. In fact, researchers have found that regular resistance training, when combined with aerobic exercise, can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months.\n\nNow, if you maintain your exercise program long term, your body might not be the only thing to benefit. Your bank account may also beef up a bit. One study revealed that older people who exercised five days a week for at least 30 minutes saved, on average, $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart-related health problems alone. You'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon.\n\nIn all probability, you're going to live longer than you otherwise would. And that longer life, it will likely feel more fulfilling, because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nOf course all these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week. A balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle. For the average adult ages 18 to 64, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2 1/2 hours per week of moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking or biking. Or at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming sprints.\n\nOn top of that, make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training. This will help your overall speed and endurance. As you begin, it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast, or you risk serious injury.\n\nYou'll discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n\nExercise smart and often, and you'll be running marathons in no time.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

The test occurred on 1/24/2018 at Kennedy Space Center's LC-39 Pad A which is the same pad that many Apollo and Space Shuttle launches took place from. SpaceX is currently leasing the pad from NASA. Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy."

Here's what will happen to your body when you exercise regularly.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nIf you're thinking about leading a more active lifestyle, you're not alone. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans have started participating in more sports, fitness, and recreation. Whether you're trying to get fit or build muscle, or you're just tired of the couch, here are some changes you can expect along the way.\n\nWhat happens to your body when you start exercising regularly?\n\nDuring that first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain. But prepare yourself for the day after, when you'll almost certainly get a case of DOMS, short for delayed onset muscle soreness. The soreness will persist for about 72 hours, but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles.\n\nOver the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs, fat, and protein into fuel that your muscles use to do their job, like flex and contract. After six to eight weeks, studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%. With more mitochondria in your cells, you'll start to feel more fit, and your endurance will increase. So running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during that first week.\n\nOnce you're six months in, all that hard work should finally start to show. If your workouts focus on strength training, you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape. You're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point. Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months, but after that more people stick with it.\n\nNow, if you're more focused on cardio, then by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max. VO2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel. Basically, higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer. So a 25% increase in VO2 max, for example, means you can run about 20% farther in the same amount of time.\n\nAfter one year of regular exercise, your bones will be denser, which reduces your risk of osteoporosis. In fact, researchers have found that regular resistance training, when combined with aerobic exercise, can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months.\n\nNow, if you maintain your exercise program long term, your body might not be the only thing to benefit. Your bank account may also beef up a bit. One study revealed that older people who exercised five days a week for at least 30 minutes saved, on average, $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart-related health problems alone. You'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon.\n\nIn all probability, you're going to live longer than you otherwise would. And that longer life, it will likely feel more fulfilling, because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nOf course all these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week. A balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle. For the average adult ages 18 to 64, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2 1/2 hours per week of moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking or biking. Or at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming sprints.\n\nOn top of that, make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training. This will help your overall speed and endurance. As you begin, it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast, or you risk serious injury.\n\nYou'll discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n\nExercise smart and often, and you'll be running marathons in no time.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Join our team of experts at 7:00am EST as they share the fascinating science, ancient lore, and human stories behind lunar eclipses - that most captivating of celestial events - as well as supermoons and blue moons.

The next total Lunar Eclipse will be on July 27, 2018. Total lunar eclipses are often referred to as “Blood Moons” because of the reddish color the Moon assumes during totality and this one promises to have a vibrant and ruddy hue. This trilogy of large full moons is not rare, but a wonderful cosmic rhythm - supermoons generally come in threes. When a Full Moon occurs when the Moon is near its closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit (termed perigee), we call it a Supermoon. Unlike solar eclipses, which are only visible from specific locations on Earth, lunar eclipses are visible anywhere it is nighttime. \n\nThe winner and runners-up of the first Fenimore Cooper Prize for Eclipse Writing will also be announced. Slooh launched this contest in August to commemorate the 2017 Transcontinental Eclipse; read all of the finalists’ submissions in January’s Best of Illuminations."

Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control).

Slooh will livecast the entire eclipse, starting at 5:45am EST. Its duration is a projected 5 hours, 17 minutes, with the totality phase lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes, starting at approximately 7:50am EST. Join our team of experts at 7:00am EST as they share the fascinating science, ancient lore, and human stories behind lunar eclipses - that most captivating of celestial events - as well as supermoons and blue moons. The eclipse will be visible from western North America, the Pacific Ocean, Australia, and parts of Asia. Slooh will feature live feeds from partners in Hawaii, Australia and Asia. \n\nThis is the first total Lunar Eclipse since September 28, 2015 and it has been almost seven years since has one entered as deeply into the umbral shadow as this one will! The next total Lunar Eclipse will be on July 27, 2018. Total lunar eclipses are often referred to as “Blood Moons” because of the reddish color the Moon assumes during totality and this one promises to have a vibrant and ruddy hue. This trilogy of large full moons is not rare, but a wonderful cosmic rhythm - supermoons generally come in threes. When a Full Moon occurs when the Moon is near its closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit (termed perigee), we call it a Supermoon. Unlike solar eclipses, which are only visible from specific locations on Earth, lunar eclipses are visible anywhere it is nighttime. \n\nThe winner and runners-up of the first Fenimore Cooper Prize for Eclipse Writing will also be announced. Slooh launched this contest in August to commemorate the 2017 Transcontinental Eclipse; read all of the finalists’ submissions in January’s Best of Illuminations."

Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control).

This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX.

Its duration is a projected 5 hours, 17 minutes, with the totality phase lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes, starting at approximately 7:50am EST. Join our team of experts at 7:00am EST as they share the fascinating science, ancient lore, and human stories behind lunar eclipses - that most captivating of celestial events - as well as supermoons and blue moons. The eclipse will be visible from western North America, the Pacific Ocean, Australia, and parts of Asia. Slooh will feature live feeds from partners in Hawaii, Australia and Asia. \n\nThis is the first total Lunar Eclipse since September 28, 2015 and it has been almost seven years since has one entered as deeply into the umbral shadow as this one will! The next total Lunar Eclipse will be on July 27, 2018. Total lunar eclipses are often referred to as “Blood Moons” because of the reddish color the Moon assumes during totality and this one promises to have a vibrant and ruddy hue. This trilogy of large full moons is not rare, but a wonderful cosmic rhythm - supermoons generally come in threes. When a Full Moon occurs when the Moon is near its closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit (termed perigee), we call it a Supermoon. Unlike solar eclipses, which are only visible from specific locations on Earth, lunar eclipses are visible anywhere it is nighttime. \n\nThe winner and runners-up of the first Fenimore Cooper Prize for Eclipse Writing will also be announced. Slooh launched this contest in August to commemorate the 2017 Transcontinental Eclipse; read all of the finalists’ submissions in January’s Best of Illuminations."

This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX.

Slooh will livecast the entire eclipse, starting at 5:45am EST. Its duration is a projected 5 hours, 17 minutes, with the totality phase lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes, starting at approximately 7:50am EST. Join our team of experts at 7:00am EST as they share the fascinating science, ancient lore, and human stories behind lunar eclipses - that most captivating of celestial events - as well as supermoons and blue moons. The eclipse will be visible from western North America, the Pacific Ocean, Australia, and parts of Asia. Slooh will feature live feeds from partners in Hawaii, Australia and Asia. \n\nThis is the first total Lunar Eclipse since September 28, 2015 and it has been almost seven years since has one entered as deeply into the umbral shadow as this one will! The next total Lunar Eclipse will be on July 27, 2018. Total lunar eclipses are often referred to as “Blood Moons” because of the reddish color the Moon assumes during totality and this one promises to have a vibrant and ruddy hue. This trilogy of large full moons is not rare, but a wonderful cosmic rhythm - supermoons generally come in threes. When a Full Moon occurs when the Moon is near its closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit (termed perigee), we call it a Supermoon. Unlike solar eclipses, which are only visible from specific locations on Earth, lunar eclipses are visible anywhere it is nighttime. \n\nThe winner and runners-up of the first Fenimore Cooper Prize for Eclipse Writing will also be announced. Slooh launched this contest in August to commemorate the 2017 Transcontinental Eclipse; read all of the finalists’ submissions in January’s Best of Illuminations."

Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control). Print resolution / size is 255 pixels wide by however long the scanner bed is.\n\nI believe it could also be useful in the kitchen for chopping vegetables."

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress.

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress.

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit.

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only.

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and help navigate through the doorway.  Controllers provide locomotion, balance and adjust behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond automatically to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.  (Note: This testing does not irritate or harm the robot.)"

The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond automatically to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.  (Note: This testing does not irritate or harm the robot.)"

The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.

The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.

The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond automatically to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.  (Note: This testing does not irritate or harm the robot.)"

The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.
